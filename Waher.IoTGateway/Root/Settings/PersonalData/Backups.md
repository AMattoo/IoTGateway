Backups
-----------------

You have the option to allow the system to create backups for you. Backups are made daily. You can also create backups manually. You choose where 
the backups are to be placed and for how long the backups are kept. You can choose to export the data in unencrypted or encrypted form.

**Note**: When making a backup of the data in your local database, data is extracted from the encrypted database and is placed in the backup file of your
choice. If you choose the file to be unencrypted, the integrity of your data might be compromised if not protected by other means. If you choose to encrypt 
the backup file, the integrity of your data might likewise be compromised, if you do not protect the key file correspondingly.
