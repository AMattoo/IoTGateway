# Waher.IoTGateway

The **Waher.IoTGateway** is a console application version of the IoT gateway. It's easy to use and experiment with. It uses XMPP and can be administered 
using the [Waher.Client.WPF](../Waher.Client.WPF) application.

The first time the application is run, it provides a simple console interface for the user to provide network credentials. 
These credentials are then stored in the **xmpp.config** file. Passwords are hashed. 

## Using standard HTTP ports

If you want to allow the gateway to have access to the HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports, you need to 
[disable any web server or service running on the machine](http://www.devside.net/wamp-server/opening-up-port-80-for-apache-to-use-on-windows),
or tell them to use different ports. This includes the HTTP Server API, (http.sys), if it is running on the machine, or any other application that 
has these ports open, like Skype. 

If running the application under Linux, you also need administrative privileges when you execute the application, to it to be able to open these ports.

>	On my Windows 8.1 machine, the following, taken from the article above, entred into a command prompt having administrator
>	privileges, and then restarting the machine, shut down the `http.sys` service.
>
>		net stop http /y
>		sc config http start= disabled
>
>	I also had to manually configure Skype to not use HTTP and HTTPS ports for incoming calls.
