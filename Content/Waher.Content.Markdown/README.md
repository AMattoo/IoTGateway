Introduction
=============

The **Waher.Content.Markdown** library is a Markdown parser written in C#. The library can, apart from parsing Markdown, also export to HTML and XAML, 
which makes it suitable for server-side CMS applictions, as well as client-side applications working with markdown. 
It's part of the [IoTGateway solution](https://github.com/PeterWaher/IoTGateway).

For an online reference to the markdown syntax supported by the library, see <https://waher.se/Markdown.md>

Markdown
==============

The markdown parser defined in **Waher.Content.Markdown** is inspired by the [original markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
as defined by John Gruber at Daring Fireball, but contains numerous other additions:

-   Markdown syntax within block-level HTML constructs is allowed.
-   Numbered lists retain the number used in the text.
-   Lazy numbering supported by prefixing items using `#.` instead of using actual numbers.
-   `_underline_` underlines text.
-   `__inserted__` displays inserted text.
-   `~strike through~` strikes through text.
-   `~~deleted~~` displays deleted text.
-   \`\` is solely used to display code. Curly quotes are inserted using normal quotes.
-   Headers receive automatic id's (camel casing).
-   Emojis are supported using the shortname syntax `:shortname:`.
-   Smileys are supported, and converted to emojis. Inspired from: http://git.emojione.com/demos/ascii-smileys.html
-   Sections can be created by separating them using a block containing a single line of `=` signs. Number of desired columns can be specified
    by dividing the line into groups of `=` signs, separating them with one or more space characters. Number of actual columns used to present
    the information will depend on medium used to display the content. Currently, only HTML supports multi-column sections, and then only if
    the client used has sufficient space to display the desired number of columns.
-	Script can be embedded in the markdown between curly braces `{` and `}`. It is evaluated and the result inserted in the final output.
-	Pre-processed script can be embedded in the markdown between double curly braces `{{` and `}}`. It is evaluated in a pre-processing phase,
	and can be used to modify the structure of the markdown document. Implicit print operations can be used to create dynamic markdown content.
-	Custom code block renderers. Using this technique, the host can integrate special handling of special types of code blocks. The IoT Gateway
	uses this feature to integrate real-time rendering of GraphViz diagrams directly into Markdown content.

-   Any multimedia, not just images, can be inserted using the `!` syntax. This includes audio and video. The architecture is pluggable and allows for 
    customization of inclusion of content, including web content such as YouTube videos, etc. Linking to a local markdown file will include the file into 
	the context of the document. This allows for markdown templates to be used, and for more complex constructs, such as richer tables, to be built. 
	Multimedia can have additional width and height information. Multimedia handler is selected based on URL or file extension. If no particular 
	multimedia handler is found, the source is considered to be an image.
    
    Examples:
    
    * `![some text](/some/url "some title" WIDTH HEIGHT)` where `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` are positive integers.
    * `![Your browser does not support the audio tag](/local/music.mp3)` (is rendered using the `<audio>` tag)
    * `![Your browser does not support the video tag](/local/video.mp4 320 200)` (is rendered using the `<video>` tag)
    * `![Your browser does not support the iframe tag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whBPLc8m4SU 800 600)` inserts an `<iframe>` embedding the YouTube video.
	* `![Table of Contents](ToC)` inserts a table of contents (`ToC` is case insensitive).
	* `![Web Page](http://example.com/Index.html 1200 300)` inserts an `<iframe>` embedding a web page.
	* `![Markdown](/Templates/template1.md)` inserts the contents of a markdown file into the current position.
    
    Width and Height can also be defined in referenced content. Example: `![some text][someref]`  
    `[someref]: some/url "some title" WIDTH HEIGHT`

	Multiresolution or Multiformatted multimedia can be included by including a sequence of sources. If inline mode is used, each source is written
	between a set of parenthesis. The sources are then optionally separated by whitespace (including on a new row).

There are numerous typographical enhancements added to the parser. These are inspired by the the [Smarty Pants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) 
addition to the original markdown, but numerous other character sequences are also supported:

| Sequence | Changed to |

| `(C)` | &COPY; |
| `(r)` | &reg; |
| `(R)` | &REG; |

Selected features from [MultiMarkdown](https://rawgit.com/fletcher/human-markdown-reference/master/index.html) and
[Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) have also been included:

-   Images placed in a paragraph by itself is wrapped in a `<figure>` tag.
-   Tables.
-   Definition lists.
-   Metadata.
-   Footnotes.
-	Fenced code blocks, with syntax highlighting.

Meta-data tags that are recognized by the parser are, as follows. Other meta-data tags are simply copied into the meta-data section of the 
generated HTML document. Keys are case insensitive.

## Example

Following is a simple example in C# on how to parse markdown text, export it to XAML and then convert it to a UIElement for display:

```csharp
Emoji1LocalFiles Emoji1_24x24 = new Emoji1LocalFiles(Emoji1SourceFileType.Png64, 24, 24, "pack://siteoforigin:,,,/Graphics/Emoji1/png/64x64/%FILENAME%");
MarkdownDocument Markdown = new MarkdownDocument(Text, new MarkdownSettings(Emoji1_24x24, false));

XamlSettings Settings = new XamlSettings();
Settings.TableCellRowBackgroundColor1 = "#20404040";
Settings.TableCellRowBackgroundColor2 = "#10808080";

string XAML = Markdown.GenerateXAML(Settings);
object UIElement = XamlReader.Parse(XAML);
```

Emojis are defined in [Waher.Content.Emoji](../../Content/Waher.Content.Emoji), and the set of free emojis from **Emoji1** is made available in the
[Waher.Content.Emoji.Emoji1](../../Content/Waher.Content.Emoji.Emoji1) project. The above code is taken from **Waher.Client.WPF** and is used to create 
chat sessions in a WPF client like the following:

![Waher.Client.WPF](../../Images/Waher.Client.WPF.1.png)

The above chat session is made with a mock temperature devices defined in [Waher.Mock.Temperature](../../Mocks/Waher.Mock.Temperature), which
uses the [Waher.Networking.XMPP.Chat](../../Networking/Waher.Networking.XMPP.Chat) project to create a sensor chat bot.
