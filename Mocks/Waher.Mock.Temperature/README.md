# Waher.Mock.Temperature

The **Waher.Mock.Temperature** project simulates a simple temperature sensor with an XMPP interface. It publishes sensor data, 
corresponding interoperability interfaces and a chat interface.

The first time the application is run, it provides a simple console interface for the user to provide network credentials. 
These credentials are then stored in the **xmpp.config** file. Passwords are hashed. 

## Console interface

It also outputs any events and network communication to the console, to facilitate implementation of IoT interfaces.

## Interaction with a Thing Registry

If the application is interacting with a Thing Registry, it will display a QR Code on the console screen during startup. This QR Code
encodes an URI containing the meta-data necessary to claim the device.

## Binary executable

You can test the application by downloading a [binary executable](../../Executables/Waher.Mock.Temperature.zip). If you don't have an XMPP client
you can use to chat with the sensor, or if the one you use does not support the XMPP IoT XEPs, you can also download the
[WPF client](../../Executables/Waher.Client.WPF.zip) available in the solution.
