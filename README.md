## Clients

The [Clients](Clients) folder contains projects starting with **Waher.Client.** and denote client projects. Clients are front-end applications that 
can be run by users to perform different types of interaction with things or the network.

### Waher.Client.WPF

| Screen Shot | Project description |
|-------------|---------------------|
|![Waher.Client.WPF](Images/Small/Waher.Client.WPF.1.png)| The [Waher.Client.WPF](Clients/Waher.Client.WPF) project is a simple IoT client that allows you to interact with things and users. If you connect to the network, you can chat with users and things. The client GUI is built using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).

|![Waher.Client.WPF](Images/Small/Waher.Client.WPF.2.png)| To allow developers to understand underlying network protocols, the IoT client provides sniffers that display detailed information about the underlying protocol. [Full Screen Shot.](Images/Waher.Client.WPF.2.png) |
|![Waher.Client.WPF](Images/Small/Waher.Client.WPF.3.png)| Apart from normal Instant Messaging features, the IoT client also includes integrated support for M2M and IoT protocols. [Full Screen Shot.](Images/Waher.Client.WPF.3.png) |

## Content

The [Content](Content) folder contains libraries that manage Internet Content Type encodings and decodings.

| Project | Project description |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Waher.Content** | The [Waher.Content](Content/Waher.Content) project is a class library that provides basic abstraction for Internet Content Type, and basic encodings and decodings. |
| **Waher.Content.Drawing** | The [Waher.Content.Drawing](Content/Waher.Content.Drawing) project contains encoders and decoders for images, as defined in the **System.Drawing** library. |

## Events

The [Events](Events) folder contains libraries that manage different aspects of event logging in networks.

| Project | Project description |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Waher.Events** | The [Waher.Events](Events/Waher.Events) project provides the basic architecture and framework for event logging in applications. It uses the static class **Log** as a hub for all type of event logging in applications. To this hub you can register any number of **Event Sinks** that receive events and distribute them according to implementation details in each one. By logging all events to **Log** you have a configurable environment where you can change logging according to specific needs of the project. |
| **Waher.Events.Console** | The [Waher.Events.Console](Events/Waher.Events.Console) project provides a simple event sink, that outputs events to the console standard output. Useful, if creating simple console applications. |
| **Waher.Events.Documentation** | The [Waher.Events.Documentation](Events/Waher.Events.Documentation) project contains documentation of specific important events. This documentation includes Event IDs and any parameters they are supposed to include. |
| **Waher.Events.XMPP** | The [Waher.Events.XMPP](Events/Waher.Events.XMPP) project defines an event sink that distributes events over XMPP, according to [XEP-0337](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0337.html). |

## Mocks

The [Mocks](Mocks) folder contains projects that implement different mock devices. These can be used as development tools to test technologies, 
implementation, networks and tools.

| Project | Project description |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Waher.Mock** | The [Waher.Mock](Mocks/Waher.Mock) project is a class library that provides support for simple mock applications. This includes simple network configuration. |
| ![Waher.Client.WPF](Images/Small/Waher.Mock.Temperature.png)| The [Waher.Mock.Temperature](Mocks/Waher.Mock.Temperature) project simulates a simple temperature sensor with an XMPP interface. The first time the application is run, it provides a simple console interface for the user to provide network credentials. It also outputs any events and network communication to the console, to facilitate implementation of IoT interfaces.

It follows the chat semantics outlined in this proto-XEP: [Chat Interface for Internet of Things Devices](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/joachimlindborg/XMPP-IoT/blob/master/xep-0000-IoT-Chat.html) |
| **Waher.Networking.XMPP.Interoperability** | The [Waher.Networking.XMPP.Interoperability](Networking/Waher.Networking.XMPP.Interoperability) project provides an add-on to the XMPP client defined in [Waher.Networking.XMPP](Networking/Waher.Networking.XMPP). This add-on provides client and server interoperability capabilities, as defined in this proto-XEP: [Internet of Things - Interoperability](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/joachimlindborg/XMPP-IoT/blob/master/xep-0000-IoT-Interoperability.html) |
