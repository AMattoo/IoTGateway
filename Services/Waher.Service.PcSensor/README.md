# Waher.Service.PcSensor

The **Waher.Service.PcSensor** project defines an application that converts your PC into an IoT sensor, by publishing performace counters as 
sensor values.

The first time the application is run, it provides a simple console interface for the user to provide network credentials. 
These credentials are then stored in the **xmpp.config** file. Passwords are hashed.

When it is read for the first time, it also creates a file called [categories.xml](#categories-xml) which lists all performance counter categories found, and 
if they should be included in the data readout or not. If new categories are found during the runtime of the application, the file is updated. 
By default, new categories are not included. 

## Console interface

The console interface can be used for two purposes:

1. To enter credentials for the XMPP connection. This is done the first time the application is run.
2. To view XMPP communication. This is done if a sniffer is enabled in the first step.

## Sensor data

The application publishes performance counter values as sensordata using XMPP, and [XEP-0323](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0323.html). 
Which performance counters to publish is defined in the [categories.xml](#categories-xml) file.

## Chat interface

As the application is available through XMPP, it also publishes a chat interface:

## Binary executable

You can test the application by downloading a [binary executable](../../Executables/Waher.Service.PcSensor.zip). If you don't have an XMPP client
you can use to chat with the sensor, or if the one you use does not support the XMPP IoT XEPs, you can also download the
[WPF client](../../Executables/Waher.Client.WPF.zip) available in the solution.

## Categories XML

After the first readout, a file called **categories.xml** is created. It includes all performance counter categories found. By default, no categories
are included in the readout. The file is updated if new categories are installed. To publish a category, set the **include** attribute to **true**.

In multi-instance categories, all instances are included by default, if not specified otherwise. To limit the category to certain instance names,
specify which ones using **Instance** elements.

### Example

Following is an example of a **categories.xml** file. Ellipsis has been used to shorten the example.

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Categories xmlns="http://waher.se/PerformanceCounterCategories.xsd">
	<Category name=".NET CLR-data" include="true" />
	<Category name=".NET CLR-nätverk" include="true" />

	<Category name=".NET-dataprovider för Oracle" include="false" />

	...
